## Website Description

This website is coded as a **take home assignment given by Zomentum.** The inspiration for this project is **web.whatsapp dark mode** which was launched recently.
This project is made using HTML CSS(Grids, flexBox) and Javascript.

This was supposed to be a **Front End Project** hence only the UI features are implemented. Although this website is meant to be used on a big screen, it is  made responsive for every device.

I could have used ReactJS (or any other framework) but the purpose of the project was to create a responsive UI and I used Vanilla css to keep things simple.
